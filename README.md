## Goal

**Crystal Clearance** is a web application designed to help groups of people manage and share expenses effortlessly. Whether you're splitting bills with roommates, organizing group trips, or tracking shared expenses with friends, this app provides a simple and intuitive platform to keep everyone's balances in check. Users can record who paid for what, calculate individual balances, and manage payments to settle debts within the group.

However, the **main goal** is having fun while writing some Rust and SolidJS.
